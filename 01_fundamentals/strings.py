# Indexing:

# string = "Python is the coolest"
# print(string[-1])
# print(string[-2])
# print(string[-10])
# print(string[-18])

# Slicing:

# print(string[::-2])

#learned that the left number starts the string on the index stated starting from zero
#learned that the middle number explains the final index that you would want syntax to go up to (but not including!)
#learned that the right number is how many characters you want to skip/slice

print("hello world, you are a champ".replace("champ", "fuckface").find("fuckface"))
